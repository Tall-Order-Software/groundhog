		title: 'Introduction to Boolean logic'
		contents: 
'Boolean logic is a way to reason about true, false, and expressions that
eventually evaluate to true or false.  It is a type of algebra in that it
defines symbols and rules for manipulating them, and a type of propositional
logic in that its expressions are formed from atomic propsitions and logical
connectives (&&, ||, and !), and rules of formal proof can determine which
additional propositions are true given a starting set of premises.  It is named
after the mathematician George Boole, who invented it.

Both algebra and logic (in this sense) are squarely in the domain of
mathematicians, and the information there is a near-infinite amount of information available.
