In grammar, a conjunction is a part of speech that connects two words, phrases or clauses.  A coordinating conjunction, or coordinator, joins two items of equal importance.  A BLCoordinator connects N BLClauses of equal importance.  In a BLClause, BLCoordinators are the root and internal nodes in the tree.

Unlike in previous versions of this library, BLCoordinators never simplify themselves implicitly. 

See BLExpression for more information.
